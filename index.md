## Online voting
I have an interest in on-line voting through my involvement in local government elections in New Zealand. I have started to create a collection of resources [here](Online-voting/).
#### Solid and online voting
There are major concerns world-wide about the security of on-line voting.  I came across the Solid project and became fascinated with its concept of people retaining their personal data. If a voter, voting on-line, retains their vote, rather than parting with it, this might enhance the verifiability of voting. The vote can be counted again, for example. Improving verifiabililty helps to counter cyber-security threats. I am keen to explore whether the Solid concept can assist the development of verifiable online voting.  I have started to record some thoughts [here](Solid-voting/).

The first step is to get my head around Solid.

## Solid
The programming language I am most proficient in is Swift on the iOS platform.  There is no-one else contributing code to the Solid platform for iOS devices, so maybe I can get my head around Solid and contribute to iOS implementations of Solid at the same time.  Experimental apps are on [Github.](https://github.com/wrmack?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=solid)

## Speaker tracker
Rules for formal debates often include limits on speaking times and the number of times a member may speak.  The chair of a meeting, or secretatial support, needs to keep a run-sheet of those who wish to speak and those who have spoken as well as time the speeches. My **Speaker tracker** app is an iPad app which does this. The code is [here](https://github.com/wrmack/SpeakerTracker).  It is also available on the Apple app store.
