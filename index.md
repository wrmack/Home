## Online voting
I have an interest in on-line voting through my involvement in local government elections in New Zealand. There are major concerns about the security of on-line voting.  I came across the Solid project and became fascinated with its concept of people retaining their personal data. If a voter retains their vote, rather than parting with it, this might enhance the verifiability of voting. The vote can be counted again, for example. I am keen to explore whether there are any aspects of this concept which might assist the development of online voting.  I have started to record some thoughts [here](Solid-and-online-voting).

The first step is to get my head around Solid.

## Solid
The programming language I an currently most proficient in is Swift on the iOS platform.  There is no-one else contributing code to Solid platform for iOS devices, so maybe I can get my head around Solid and contribute to iOS implementations of Solid at the same time.  Experimental apps are on [Github.](https://github.com/wrmack?tab=repositories)

## Speaker tracker
Rules for formal debates often include limits on speaking times and how many times a member may speak.  The chair of a meeting needs to keep a run-sheet of those who wish to speak and those who have spoken as well as time the speeches. My Speaker tracker app is an iPad app which does this. The code is [here](https://github.com/wrmack/SpeakerTracker).
